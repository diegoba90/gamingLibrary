Was tasked with creating a situation that could happen in real life. It was created in the mindset of a business owner asking a freelance software developer to create a program that will meet his needs. The program created allows a new gaming store owner to keep track of his/her inventory.

The proposed project is as follows:
After the recent pandemic and economical shutdown, the gaming industry saw a drastic spike in the demand. Due to this research a local family in Montgomery, AL decided to start a business where they sold, bought, and rented video games. Due to the popularity of Nintendo, Sony, and Microsoft, they decided that they were going to stock PlayStation 4/5, Xbox One/X/S, and Nintendo Switch games. The store grew to be extremely successful. However, because it was owned by an older family that didnâ€™t know much about technology, they decided to hire a software engineer to create a program that will allow them to keep up with their inventory. They asked for the program to do the following:

1.	Add new game. This function will allow them to add to their inventory any game they may have bought
2.	Remove game. This function will remove any games that have been sold
3.	Clear inventory. This function will allow them to reset and reorganize after annual inventories.
4.	Display all games. Will allow them to see their stock.
5.	Count by gaming system. This will allow them to see how many games they have for each system.
6.	Sort by rating. This will allow them to see how many games of a certain rating they have.
7.	Search by title. This will allow them to see if they own a certain game or not.
8.	Exit

This program will utilize the following templates and algorithms:
a.	Will use a struct that will contain the games
b.	Will use an algorithm to add a game
c.	Will use an algorithm to remove a game
d.	Will use an algorithm to clear the contents of file
e.	Will use an template to display all contents

Things learned:
1. How to use STL Algorithms.
2. How to use STL Templates.
3. How to implement C++ to solve a real life scenario.
